We were digging up the backyard to plant some hop rhizomes on a typical Moorpark hot sunny Saturday afternoon and only had stout to drink.\n\nThis beer was designed to be enjoyed on a hot summer day. Light American malt together with a cold fermentation and low alcohol content combine to create a crisp and refreshing brew. The American hops used add a citrus and floral taste to the beer which is accentuated with the light malt used. \n\nThe term Session Ale originates from World War I. Session refers to two drinking periods shell production works had during the day. The sessions were 11am to 3pm and 7pm to 10pm. During these short 4 hour periods, workers wanted a beer that they could drink without getting drunk before returning to shell production.\n\nThe backbone of our recipe was created two summers ago. We were digging up the backyard to plant some hop rhizomes on a typical Moorpark hot sunny Saturday afternoon. Of course, while planting hops we wanted to enjoy some of our homebrew - however all we had at the time was a thick Imperial Stout. So, craving something refreshing and tasty, we brewed the Captainâ€™s Summer Session. And the name, well Captain Chris Enegren is always yelling at brewery personnel to get back to work, so it seemed fitting. Luckily, unlike WWI shell producers, we can drink on the job.","created_at":"Sun, 28 Aug 2011 15:55:28 +0000","beer_style":"Golden Ale","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"in_production":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":14167,"brewery_name":"Enegren Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"enegren-brewing-company","brewery_label":"https:\/\/untappd.akamaized.net\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-EnegrenBrewingCompany_14167.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"EnegrenBrewing","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/enegrenbrewing","instagram":"@enegrenbrewing","url":"http:\/\/www.enegrenbrewing.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Moorpark","brewery_state":"CA","lat":34.2831,"lng":-118.871},"brewery_active":1}},{"checkin_count":230,"have_had":false,"your_count":0,"beer":{"bid":326792,"beer_name":"Captain Patrick","beer_label":"https:\/\/untappd.akamaized.net\/site\/assets\/images\/temp\/badge-beer-default.png","beer_abv":4,"beer_slug":"enegren-brewing-company-captain-patrick","beer_ibu":0,"beer_description":"","created_at":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 15:17:12 +0000","beer_style":"Stout -
